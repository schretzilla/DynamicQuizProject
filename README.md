DynamicQuizProject

This project is my introduction to Django.

The dynamic quiz will allow users to create quizes containing questions and view the results of the reponses.

To set up Django virtual environment on linux run 
$ source ./DjangoEnv/bin/activate

Run server using: python dynoquiz/manage.py runserver 

By default DynoQuiz is running at 127.0.0.1:8000/dynoquiz/quiz
